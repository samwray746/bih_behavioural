# This is the main script for a task investigating repetition suppression of the heartbeat-evoked potential. Some key details: 
    
# - Stimuli will be ontained from the NimStim dataset of face stimuli. Faces either show disgust (D), or are neutral (N)

# - There will be 21 experimental blocks, with each block consisting of 40 trials (40 being the number of actors in the NimStim dataset)
# - In each trial, the same identity face will be presented for 500ms, interspersed with a 500ms fixation cross
# - During a repetition trial, face presentations are identical (D-D or N-N)
# - During an alternation trial, the face presentations are non-identical (D-N or N-D)

# - Trials are presented in three stimulus contexts, which each occur in 7 blocks: 1) Cue-useful blocks 2) Cue-sometimes useful blocks 3) Cue-useless blocks 
# - During a cue-useful block, whenever the fixation cross is red/green/yellow (i.e., non-white), a repetition trial ALWAYS occurs
# - During a cue-sometimes useful block, the non-white fixation cross predicts a repetition trial with 75% accuracy 
# - During a cue-useless block, the non-white fixation cross predicts a repetition trial with 50% accuracy (i.e., chance)

# - In 20% of all trials, arrows apppear overlaying the faces, necessitating a which-direction response to maintain and check for attention

 
### IMPORTS ###

from psychopy import event, visual, gui, core

from experimental_variables_function import experimental_variables # importing function that creates the main variables for the experiment 

### GATHERING PARTICIPANT INFO ###

                    'Order': '', 'Random seed': ''} # dictionary specifying participant info 

myDlg = gui.DlgFromDict(participant_info, title="Emotional faces experiment") # creating the dialogue box object

## Converting participant info to appropriate data-types ##     
order = int(participant_info['Order']) # Following Marshall & Schutz-Bosach 2017, we want to present the different experimental blocks as a unit. So we have 6 different 'orders',
# corresponding to the 6 permutations of presentation (i.e., ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CAB, CBA)

### CREATING THE WIN OBJECT ### 

win = visual.Window(color = '#000000', fullscr = True, monitor="testMonitor", units="pix") # Will need to change units to 'degree' when we know distance from monitor 
win.mouseVisible = False
