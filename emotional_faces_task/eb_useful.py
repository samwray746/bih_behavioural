    ### Setting up the structure of the experimental block. Some details: ###
        
    # 1) Each block consists of 40 trials i.e., the same number of actors we have in our stimulus set
    # 2) In each block, there are 20 repetition trials and 20 alternation trials
    # 3) In half of the 20 repetition/alternation trials a disgust face will be presented first, and in the other half a neutral face will be presented 
    # 4) In a cue useful block, whenever it's a repetition trial the fixation cross will always be non-white
